    "### The Python Data Model\n",
    "The Python Data Model allows the consistency of the language. It can be seen as framework which formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of Python. In other words, it is a collection of interfaces that define how Python built-in behaviors and operations should interact with objects (through dunder nethods).  \n",
    "When we code in Python, the interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations based on a special syntax (`__some_method__`).  \n",
    "When custom methods implement special (dunder) methods, they can behave as built-in types. This is achieved thanks to operator overloading.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "All data in a Python program can be repesented by objects or relations between objects. In other words, data is encapsulated within objects in Python. An object is a collection of data and methods that act on the data. This allows for a higher abstraction level, where the use can focus on the operations that can be performed with such objects rather than the internall implementation of data. These objects can interact with each other in various manners, such as passing messages or invoking methods. Python also treat code as objects. This is a important feature of high level languages when we think in a functional manner, because in this model functions can be treated as just another object for example.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Each object in Python has and identity, a type and a value. It is important to note that a object identity never changes once it has been created. This identity can be tought as the memory adress of the object. In this scenario, the `is` operator is the way to compare the identity of two objects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ID\n",
    "The `id` fuction returns the memory adress of a object and is unchangeable. Despite being a general information about every Python object, the *id* sometime is obtained through some optimizations, as listed bellow:  "

    "In the above code we used two ways of calculating the size of a python object. `getsizeof` returns the size of the object passed to it only whereas `asizeof` returns the size of the object passed to it but also the objects referenced within the complex object instance.   \n",
    "In general, `getsizeof` only reports the raw memory allocated (header and its immediate contents) for the list's data and it is based on the interpreter's internal calculations.  \n",
    "`asizeof` does that by recursively adding up the sizes of all objects after traversing the object contents and examining the object attributes. `asizeof` also avoids calculating the size of the same object twice, in the case of this object be referenced more than once, by keeping tracking of the objcets IDs that it already visited by using a `set` or something a similar mechanism that allow it to recognize already-measured objects. It is important to note that it uses `getsizeof` to measure the size of the objects encountered and also take account of the extra space allocated by containers objects since some Python objects have over-allocation to amortized append operations, furthermore it also is capable of detecting shared objects, such as objects that are instances of classes with `__slots__` or some interned objects like strings. Although very useful, `asizeof` returns the estimated size of the objects plus all of it referents (_referents_ are objects acessible from the parent object according tho the traversal of its attributes and contents).  \n",
    "In summary, `asizeof` does the following:  \n",
    "1 - Indentify the object type;  \n",
    "2 - Consult a pre-defined table with estimated base sizes for different object types;  \n",
    "3 - Evaluate the content and (a) if applicable, recursively iterate through the object contents or/and (b) for each element, repeat the steps 1-3 to estimate the size and accumulate it to the total;  \n",
    "4 - Keeps track of objects by analyzing internal references within the parent objects and adds the contribution for referenced objects (avoidind double counting);  \n",
    "5 - Apply additional estimations for header infos and garbage collection, while avoiding double counting;  \n",
    "6 - Returns the summed up size of the traversed object.   \n",

    "Another way to think about collections in Python is comparing Mutable and Immutable objects. The difference between them is clear, but it's worth mentioning that Mutable sequences inherit all the Immutable sequences' methods."
